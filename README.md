# Video Game Sales Data Pipeline and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involved building a complete data pipeline and performing a comprehensive analysis of video game sales data. Utilized multiple tools to extract, transform, load, and visualize the data.

## Tools Used
- **Kaggle**: Data source for video game sales, including game titles, publishers, sales figures, release dates, and critic scores.
- **Fivetran**: Automated data extraction and loading into our Snowflake data warehouse.
- **Snowflake**: Cloud-based data warehouse for storing and managing the data.
- **dbt Labs**: Applied transformations to clean, normalize, and enrich the data for analysis, including data quality tests.
- **Tableau**: Created interactive dashboards to visualize key insights and trends.
- **GitHub**: Managed version control, collaborating on code and tracking changes throughout the project.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Automated extraction from Kaggle using Fivetran, with data loaded directly into Snowflake.
- **Data Transformation**: dbt was used to transform the raw data, ensuring it was clean, standardized, and ready for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau dashboards provided visual insights into key business questions, including:
  - Top 10 best-selling video games of all time
  - Publisher performance across top-selling games
  - Impact of release dates on sales
  - Genre popularity trends and critic score correlations

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Set up Fivetran to pull data from Kaggle.
3. Configure Snowflake as the data warehouse.
4. Use dbt to run transformations and prepare the data.
5. Access Tableau for visualization and analysis.
